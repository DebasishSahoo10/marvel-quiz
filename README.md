# A CLI Quiz App - For Marvel Fans
> Version 1

This is a CLI app written in JavaScript using Repl. This app runs a quiz about some facts of Marvel Movies which will be fun to play for all Marvel fans out there. Open the Repl Link - click on "Run" - You are ready to check your love for Marvel. And for the source code you can check the files above. We are also currently keep a track of high score and show it to the user at the end of the QUIZ. And for the styling we used CHALK - a npm module to stylize the console outputs. Chalk Installation code : `var readlineSync = require("readline-sync")` but the latest version of CHALK module is not compatible with REPL, so I have to mannually downgrade it ro v4.1.2 in the _package.json_ file.
